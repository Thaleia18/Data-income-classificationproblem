Go to binaryclassification.pdf for full details

The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year.

### I  used five different classification algorithms:

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Logistic classifier

SVM classifier

K Neighbors Classifier

### The data  was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database .
